2021-06-13 17:27:59|"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."|3659|255
2021-06-13 17:21:58|"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."|6330|420

2020-06-21 04:29:09|@TslaCybertruck @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD|859|39
2020-06-21 04:27:12|@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?|1064|59
2020-06-21 04:04:19|@uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This does sound excessive. Will look into it.|1026|30
2020-06-21 04:03:33|@Flash_Titans Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure.|1166|47

2020-06-21 03:28:55|@cleantechnica Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies|7615|690
