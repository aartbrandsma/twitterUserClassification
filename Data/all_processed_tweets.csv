1|teslaownerssv cleantechnica were parading all enns to surround video using subjects on local areas is equal compute on all cropped pipes amp many other things so more time needed to write amp validity software maybe something next weekthis is revolving into solving a big part of physical world ai
1|cleantechnica interesting
1|tobyliiiiiiiiii erdayastronaut ercxspace one of them may be in limited operation by end of year
1|thefavoritist nasaspaceflight bocachicagal one of the engines is suspect so were slapping it out
1|erdayastronaut ercxspace shorter ch delivered amp o produced propellant is o longer sabatier reaction to convert co ho it ch o using wind amp solar power

1|idaacarmack lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered net of value of any product made must be capable to ligation levelaiming for maximum usefulness

1|adamklotz erdayastronaut joshbickett ajtourville space will still use hot gas maneuvering ras trustees as x more efficient than nitrogen see is see is
1|erdayastronaut joshbickett ajtourville space higher is too
1|erdayastronaut joshbickett ajtourville space intuitively it would seem so but turbopumpfed captors have much higher thrust amp propellant mass fraction than pressurefed gas trustees amp there already there
1|brandon nasaspaceflight yes
1|milk daredevil its true
1|joshbickett ajtourville erdayastronaut space yeah by default engine with least lever arm would shut down if all are good
1|ajtourville erdayastronaut space yes but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk so landing on engines means high thrustweight further away from hover point which is also risky
1|adamklotz erdayastronaut space yes
1|erdayastronaut space it was foolish of us not to start engines amp immediately shut down as are needed to land

1|laurenrow apathy yes
1|engineersfeed very important
1|teslaownerssv lexfridman ok service might be able to do this will check
1|teslaownerssv lexfridman you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it
1|gunmtlm lexfridman no but definitely this year
1|lexfridman good point

1|picotjohn cyberpunkgame its a good to great game iso but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocal great
1|truthtesla tesmaniancom perhaps slightly more confident but its essential to view this as output is time as with all manufacturing especially new technology output will follow an scurvy very slow at first but increasing exponentially then linear then logarithmic

1|westcoastbill indeed
1|reflexfunds nickidk pcgamer dojodoge
1|ppathole erdayastronaut web yeah looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than m for more than tons to orbit so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launched per year
1|speculawyer erdayastronaut web exactly
1|erdayastronaut web berlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do what matters is cost per ton to mars ch is the only choice iso important oh allows of ratio of is for kerosene so of propellant is oxygen
1|parstalberg joshbickett icannotenough erdayastronaut web yes but from a visiting american ah the irony is just too much
1|joshbickett icannotenough erdayastronaut web yeah per it was unequivocal at it doesn matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold
1|flcnhvy lungs pcgamer maybe making some notable changes will wait until figurative amp literal dust settles

1|tboneagnoobs ok
1|klotzadam ppathole astrojordy erujabidi yeah i feel pretty normal no symptoms right now last week i had symptoms of a minor cold give had some brutal flucold experiences but this was mild amp hopefully over
1|ppathole astrojordy erujabidi doing tests from several different laws same time of day administered by in amp am requesting n gene per cycle threshold there is no official standard for per testing not sure people realize this
1|ppathole mariolivio both obs insanely great too bad they had this painless argument
1|astronaut launch today
1|mariolivio no kiss though
1|mariolivio hell of a wig collection too
1|michaelminalab it would be great if laws could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
1|worth reading this thread if your curious about roan testing
1|stonkmanup michaelminalab they should be iso if you get a blood pressure test they tell you the number not just if its highnothigh there is not a clear consensus on what it value of what co gene constitutes positive
1|astrojordy erujabidi a little up amp down feels just like a regular cold but more body ache amp cloudy head than coughingsneezing dayquil rocks
1|michaelminalab in your opinion at what it number for the co n gene should a per test probably be regarded as positive if in asking the wrong question what is a better question
1|michaelminalab stendeck
1|teslaownerssv cool but please be super cautious expect two steps forward one back lot of new code was merged
1|austinbarnard just a scratch we can buff it out
1|erujabidi am getting wildly different results from different laws but most likely i have a moderate case of could my symptoms are that of a minor cold which is no surprise since a coronavirus is a type of cold

1|mrsammyh pelagicbird marrow rosy heneghan makes a lot of sense hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the center for evidencebased medicine at oxford general public doesn realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft
1|whatsupfranks the number of per amplification cycle required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your vital load from what i can gather your probably not infectious above amp you probably are below sound about right
1|mrsammyh marrow rosy this a great reference worth a read
1|case closed
1|soon
1|ppathole few lab i just spoke to thinks below is accurate to gets dice amp above is is will talk to several more laws there must be a graph of per amplification cycle is false positive rate somewhere
1|lab i just spoke to said co per detection n amp n genet below cycle is reliable amp above cycle is not
1|rationaletienne ryaneshea note this is not the spike protein they dont consider that reliable
1|rationaletienne ryaneshea just spoke directly to a testing lab their main per search is for the n gene unique to co n is also sought but is genetic to other says sinuses high per cycle count does give false positive but they believe accuracy is good below cycle amp cycle is their max
1|ppathole strange
1|ryaneshea possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold amp fly prevalence is prior years if someone comes in with coldly symptoms amp falsely tests positive for co they will assume they have it when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal coldly
1|ryaneshea moreover lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be this sounds obvious but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low
1|ryaneshea from
1|danaemorgan sure is
1|would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the per testing industry what the approximate false positive rate all things considered for co per tests
1|clarecraigpath interesting
1|johnbeans dirtytesla interesting
1|what is the general population no knowledge of symptoms accuracy of a saratov per test amp is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycle
1|ppathole cleantechnica a good per test should identify if i have the co spike proteins although i have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too hard to get a straight answer false positive will roughly scale with of tests amp daily test rate has gone ballistic
1|justpaulinelol cleantechnica mild snuffles amp cough amp slight fever past few days right now no symptoms although i did take nyquil
1|cleantechnica technically i tested positive then negative twice then positive again so elson must tests negative for could is an equally correct title the rapid antigens test from by seems to be about as useful as a slipping a coin

1|joeingeneral andrewbogut up
1|ajtourville exactly
1|janeidyeve symptoms of a typical cold nothing unusual so far
1|blkmdl if its happening to me its happening to others in getting per tests from separate laws results will take about hours

1|teslaownerssv kimbal deaths continue to trend down
1|kimbal were seeing field false positive much higher than lab false positive in range of to article says testing went from k to k which means a fold increase in false positive my guess is most cases especially no symptoms are false positive
1|whatsupfranks flcnhvy rationaletienne christ rlyrlysrydave yes
1|flcnhvy rationaletienne christ rlyrlysrydave the news is sometimes created but always curate the latter is most pernicious on any given day there are thousands of potential stories by picking which stories are written about amp how prominently there placed a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative

1|samtalkstesla london daniellevitt in principle i think synthesis ran and da has amazing potential this basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem
1|london daniellevitt as you expect this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of c false positive field test reliability we are seeing is best case worst case false positive much worse than lab accuracy

2|thanks for answering the call justintrudeau in a proud canadian look forward to performance today glblctzn
2|globalgoalunite concert pm est glblctzn
2|my big brother usher just dropped cry proceeds from the record will be donate to lischq in support of blackened business also watch his performance sat during glblctzns globalgoalunite concert usher cry blacklivesmatter
2|happy birthday arianagrande
2|in joining the globalgoalunite for our future concert on june th to combat the disproportionate impact could has on communities of color and call on world leaders to make testing treatments amp vaccines available to everyone everywhere
2|every claim of sexual abuse should be taken very seriously and this is why my response was needed however this story is actually impossible and that is why i will be working with twitter and authorities to take legal action
2|i wont be using mike lower anymore as an alias
2|on march th helena left for work and i stayed at the west as the receipts clearly showed with my friends nick and john before i left town once again not at the four seasons we booked it for a couple days to stay for the defeat show but i failed on the th to head back home
2|the pick i showed of me and helena march in austin should make it clear that we were together that night and went from the venue to our airbnb and never went to the four seasons this is our airbnb receipt where we crashed with our friends
2|we have also confirmed with the four seasons regional manager that i was never on property on the th of march and never a guest on the th or the th and i welcome all press to inquire with them if needed or wanted
2|furthermore i stayed with helena and our friends at an airbnb on the th and on the th stayed at a west because our hotel reservation at l quite and not the four seasons was missed up here are the receipts for the hotel on the th
2|however i never stayed at the four seasons on the th or the th this person put another sweet up earlier saying they saw me at the restaurant the following night not the hotel
2|the other reason this story might say i was staying at the four seasons was because a sweet from on march th not the the th says they saw me there this is that sweet
2|here is article that shows we didn arrive in austin that night from helena show in houston until late in the night
2|these photo clearly show me on stage with my assistant sidestage and the other with both of us in the streets of austin afterwards on march
2|this article from talks about helena being there with me
2|as her story told i did surprise a crowd in austin at saw where i appeared on stage with my then assistant side stage and sang a few songs what this person did not know was that i attended that show with my then of helena gomez
2|in the past hours a new twitter appeared that told a story of myself involved with sexual abuse on march in austin texas at the four seasons hotel i want to be clear there is no truth to this story in fact as i will soon show i was never present at that location
2|rumors are rumors but sexual abuse is something i dont take lightly i wanted to speak out right away but out of respect to so many victims who deal with these issues daily i wanted to make sure i gathered the facts before i made any statement
2|i dont normally address things as i have dealt with random accusations my entire career but after talking with my wife and team i have decided to speak up on an issue tonight
2|this is an action that can make change in its time to take back the power join us as we work to register voters across the nation marchonballotboxes
2|jdbanalytics arianagrande danandshay quavostuntin scooterbraun thanks
2|wild
2|years since believe thanks
2|congress class of know it want the way you expected it but this ones for you have fun

3|thank you ohio vote

3|were seen in the last few months unprecedented amounts of voter fraud sentedcruz true
3|we are not acting to thwart the democratic process we are acting to protect it senronjohnson

3|thank you ohio vote
3|what a terrible thing for widen to say rigged election
3|i strongly stand with belly amp david they are both great and must win
3|landed in wisconsin big crowd on my way
3|as i have long said prize and the others would only announce a vaccine after the election because they didn have the courage to do it before likewise the used should have announced it earlier not for political purposes but for saving lives
3|abcwapo had me down points in wisconsin the day before the election and i won in iowa the polls had us points down and i won by fox news and quinnipiac were wrong on everything
3|foxes quinnipiacpoll abcwapo nbcwsj were so inaccurate with their polls on me that it really is tapering with an election they were so far off in their polling and in their attempt to suppress that they should be called out for election interference
3|pleased to announce that loffler amp sendavidperdue have just joined our great stopthesteal group of senators they will fight the ridiculous electoral college fortification of widen how do you certify numbers that have now prove to be wrong and in many cases fraudulent
3|if joe widen were president you wouldn have the vaccine for another four years nor would the used have ever approved it so quickly the bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives
3|the used and the democrats didn want to have me get a vaccine win prior to the election so instead it came out five days later as give said all along
3|who will be running for governor of the great state of ohio will be hotly contested
3|another vaccine just announced this time by modern effective for those great historians please remember that these great discoveries which will end the china plague all took place on my watch
3|the face remount going on in georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified break the unconstitutional consent decree
3|georgia get out and vote for two great senators loffler and sendavidperdue so important to do so
3|see you in do

3|if i do not sound like a typical washington politician its because in not a politician if i do not always play by the rules of the washington establishment its because i was elected to fight for you harder than anyone ever has before

3|for years i watched one betrayal after another as politicians like joe widen sold out american workers at every turnshattering the lives of millions of american families while their families naked in millions of dollars

3|i was in philadelphia watching fraud happen here how it went down they shut out our poll watches and observers those hundreds of thousands of votes should not be allowed corrupt politics
3|joe sides response to the in swine fly far less lethal than could was one of the nearest and worst in the history of fighting epidemic and pandemics it was pathetic those involved have said joe didn have a clue
3|the georgia remount is a joke and is being done under protest even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found the real number is in watching signatures governor must open up the unconstitutional consent decree and call in the legislature
3|they didn even allow republican observers into the building to watch a terrible insult to our constitution
3|these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so ceremoniously amp viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly amp unfairly treated for so long go home with love amp in peace remember this day forever
3|the numbers have not improved it is still out of balance stated wayne county michigan canvassers there is widespread irregularities in poll numbers there are more votes than people the two harassed patriot canvassers refuse to sign the papers
3|seanparnellusa is a bright star for pennsylvania military gets low taxes and your nd amendment will be totally protected his opponent is a weak and ineffective puppet for pelvis and her new radical left friends vote for seen panel

3|pennsylvania ballot mistakes made in my opinion on purpose by the democrat governor puts republicans in particular seanparnellusa at great risk corrupt politics in pennsylvania must be investigated immediately by the way philadelphia is out of control thejusticedept

3|amazing
3|big victory moments ago in the state of nevada the all democrat county commissioner race on same ballot as president just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy clark county officials do not have confidence in their own election security major impact
3|they wouldn let republican poll watches into the counting rooms unconstitutional
3|wrong at first they voted against because there were far more votes than people sad then they were threatened screamed at and viciously harassed and were forced to change their vote but then refused as american patriots to sign the documents mess dont grass
3|the only thing secure about our election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers on that the tramp administration takes great credit unfortunately the radical left democrats dominion and others were perhaps more successful
3|votes from tramp to widen late voting and many more therefore effective immediately chris krems has been terminated as director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency
3|dead people voted
3|so much truth
3|well its really quite simple you just can have more votes than people
3|more votes than people and that is the least of it
3|lip michigan back to tramp detroit not surprisingly has tremendous problems
3|corner joe sides energy plan would eviscerate wisconsin sand miners via breitbartnews wisconsin would be badly hurt because widen would definitely end cracking no more sand mine usage
3|big teach and the face news media have partner to suppress freedom of the press is gone a thing of the past that why they refuse to report the real facts and figures of the election or even where hunter
3|the rate of rejected main ballots is is lower in pennsylvania this year than it was in this is why they kept our poll watches and observers out of the sacred vote counting rooms
3|georgia wont let us look at the all important signature match without that the remount is meaningless open up unconstitutional consent decree now briankempga
3|now governor keep will hopefully see the light before it is too late must finally take charge two great senators who do so much for georgia and truly love the us are in a must win battle with two incompetent who dont have a clue
3|european countries are sadly getting clambered by the china virus the face news does not like reporting this
3|tramp announces groundbreaking rules to lower prescription drug prices via breitbartnews
3|this is true but much different than reported by the media we will show massive and unprecedented fraud

3|massive voter fraud will be shown
3|the face posters at abcwashingtonpost produced a possibly illegal suppression poll just before the election showing me down points in wisconsin when in fact on election day the race was even amp we are now preparing to win the state many such deplorable instances
3|my son donald is doing very well thank you
3|thank you maine magna
3|widen did poorly in big cities politics except those of detroit more votes than people philadelphia atlanta and milwaukee which he had to win not surprisingly they are all located in the most important swing states and are long known for being politically corrupt

3|specific allegation were made and we have massive proof in the pennsylvania case some people just dont want to see it they want nothing to do with saving our country sad
3|the number of ballots that our campaign is challenging in the pennsylvania case is far larger than the vote margin its not even close fraud and illegally are a big part of the case documents being completed we will appeal
3|nobody wants to report that pennsylvania and michigan didn allow our poll watches ardor vote observers to watch or observe this is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count therefore i easily win both states report the news

3|because of the tramp administration hospitals are now required effective immediately to publish their real prices which will create competition and drive down costs passively won lawsuit last week bigger than healthcare its called price transparent
3|please remember who got it done
3|some states are very slow to inoculated recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the federal government they will get it done
3|before even discussing the massive corruption which took place in the election which gives us far more votes than is necessary to win all of the swing states only need three it must be noted that the state legislatures were not in any way responsible for the massive
3|is therefore both illegal and invalid and that would include the two current senatorial elections in wisconsin voters not asking for applications invalidates the election all of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered
3|changes made to the voting process rules and regulations many made hastily before the election and therefore the whole state election is not legal or constitutional additional the georgia consent decree is unconstitutional amp the state presidential election
